/*
Challenge - Transform SimpleDate into an Enum Class!
- Make it an Enum Class and call it `Month` instead of `SimpleDate`
- Turn that months array into the enum cases
- Get the monthsUntilJingleBells and monthsUntilHalloweenDecorations methods working again
- Write a new property named `season` with a custom getter that will return the season of the year
for each month. (Maybe model `Season` as another Enum Class?)
